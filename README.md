# Streamlit Demo: Eco Rating Comparator

This is a Streamlit demo app to compare Eco Rating scores for smartphones.

Smartphone information and global scores come from the Orange website: [here](https://boutique.orange.fr/mobile/mobiles-et-smartphones).

Sub-scores are approximates. They were computed automatically from the progress bars on the Eco Rating pictures.
